The function estimates the intrinsic camera parameters and extrinsic parameters for each of the views. The algorithm is based on @cite Zhang2000 and @cite BouguetMCT . The coordinates of 3D object points and their corresponding 2D projections in each view must be specified. That may be achieved by using an object with known geometry and easily detectable feature points. Such an object is called a calibration rig or calibration pattern, and OpenCV has built-in support for a chessboard as a calibration rig (see @ref findChessboardCorners). Currently, initialization of intrinsic parameters (when @ref CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is not set) is only implemented for planar calibration patterns (where Z-coordinates of the object points must be all zeros). 3D calibration rigs can also be used as long as initial cameraMatrix is provided. The algorithm performs the following steps: Compute the initial intrinsic parameters (the option only available for planar calibration patterns) or read them from the input parameters. The distortion coefficients are all set to zeros initially unless some of CALIB_FIX_K? are specified. Estimate the initial camera pose as if the intrinsic parameters have been already known. This is done using @ref solvePnP . Run the global Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm to minimize the reprojection error, that is, the total sum of squared distances between the observed feature points imagePoints and the projected (using the current estimates for camera parameters and the poses) object points objectPoints. See @ref projectPoints for details.

an image from one color space to another. The function converts an input image from one color space to another. In case of a transformation to-from RGB color space, the order of the channels should be specified explicitly (RGB or BGR). Note that the default color format in OpenCV is often referred to as RGB but it is actually BGR (the bytes are reversed). So the first byte in a standard (24-bit) color image will be an 8-bit Blue component, the second byte will be Green, and the third byte will be Red. The fourth, fifth, and sixth bytes would then be the second pixel (Blue, then Green, then Red), and so on. The conventional ranges for R, G, and B channel values are: 0 to 255 for CV_8U images 0 to 65535 for CV_16U images 0 to 1 for CV_32F images In case of linear transformations, the range does not matter. But in case of a non-linear transformation, an input RGB image should be normalized to the proper value range to get the correct results, for example, for RGB \\f$\\rightarrow\\f$ L*u*v* transformation. For example, if you have a 32-bit floating-point image directly converted from an 8-bit image without any scaling, then it will have the 0..255 value range instead of 0..1 assumed by the function. So, before calling #cvtColor , you need first to scale the image down: img * = 1 . / 255 ; cvtColor ( img , img , COLOR_BGR2Luv ) ; If you use #cvtColor with 8-bit images, the conversion will have some information lost. For many applications, this will not be noticeable but it is recommended to use 32-bit images in applications that need the full range of colors or that convert an image before an operation and then convert back.

Also, the function performance depends very much, and not monotonically, on the array size (see getOptimalDFTSize ). In the current implementation DCT of a vector of size N is calculated via DFT of a vector of size N/2 .

As the image denoising, in particular, may be seen as the variational problem, primal-dual algorithm then can be used to perform denoising and this is exactly what is implemented. It should be noted, that this implementation was taken from the July 2013 blog entry @cite MA13 , which also contained (slightly more general) ready-to-use source code on Python. Subsequently, that code was rewritten on C++ with the usage of openCV by Vadim Pisarevsky at the end of July 2013 and finally it was slightly adapted by later authors. Although the thorough discussion and justification of the algorithm involved may be found in @cite ChambolleEtAl, it might make sense to skim over it here, following @cite MA13 . To begin with, we consider the 1-byte gray-level images as the functions from the rectangular domain of pixels (it may be seen as set \\f$\\left\\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{N}\\times\\mathbb{N}\\mid 1\\leq x\\leq n,\\;1\\leq y\\leq m\\right\\}\\f$ for some \\f$m,\\;n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\f$) into \\f$\\{0,1,\\dots,255\\}\\f$. We shall denote the noised images as \\f$f_i\\f$ and with this view, given some image \\f$x\\f$ of the same size, we may measure how bad it is by the formula \\f[\\left\\|\\left\\|\\nabla x\\right\\|\\right\\| + \\lambda\\sum_i\\left\\|\\left\\|x-f_i\\right\\|\\right\\|\\f] \\f$\\|\\|\\cdot\\|\\|\\f$ here denotes \\f$L_2\\f$-norm and as you see, the first addend states that we want our image to be smooth (ideally, having zero gradient, thus being constant) and the second states that we want our result to be close to the observations we've got. If we treat \\f$x\\f$ as a function, this is exactly the functional what we seek to minimize and here the Primal-Dual algorithm comes into play. observations . be restored. result . storage space, as it will be automatically allocated, if necessary. lambda .

It was borrowed from IPL (Intel* Image Processing Library). Here is how 2D CCS spectrum looks: \\f[\\begin{bmatrix} Re Y_{0,0} &amp; Re Y_{0,1} &amp; Im Y_{0,1} &amp; Re Y_{0,2} &amp; Im Y_{0,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; Re Y_{0,N/2-1} &amp; Im Y_{0,N/2-1} &amp; Re Y_{0,N/2} \\\\ Re Y_{1,0} &amp; Re Y_{1,1} &amp; Im Y_{1,1} &amp; Re Y_{1,2} &amp; Im Y_{1,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; Re Y_{1,N/2-1} &amp; Im Y_{1,N/2-1} &amp; Re Y_{1,N/2} \\\\ Im Y_{1,0} &amp; Re Y_{2,1} &amp; Im Y_{2,1} &amp; Re Y_{2,2} &amp; Im Y_{2,2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; Re Y_{2,N/2-1} &amp; Im Y_{2,N/2-1} &amp; Im Y_{1,N/2} \\\\ \\hdotsfor{9} \\\\ Re Y_{M/2-1,0} &amp; Re Y_{M-3,1} &amp; Im Y_{M-3,1} &amp; \\hdotsfor{3} &amp; Re Y_{M-3,N/2-1} &amp; Im Y_{M-3,N/2-1}&amp; Re Y_{M/2-1,N/2} \\\\ Im Y_{M/2-1,0} &amp; Re Y_{M-2,1} &amp; Im Y_{M-2,1} &amp; \\hdotsfor{3} &amp; Re Y_{M-2,N/2-1} &amp; Im Y_{M-2,N/2-1}&amp; Im Y_{M/2-1,N/2} \\\\ Re Y_{M/2,0} &amp; Re Y_{M-1,1} &amp; Im Y_{M-1,1} &amp; \\hdotsfor{3} &amp; Re Y_{M-1,N/2-1} &amp; Im Y_{M-1,N/2-1}&amp; Re Y_{M/2,N/2} \\end{bmatrix}\\f] In case of 1D transform of a real vector, the output looks like the first row of the matrix above. So, the function chooses an operation mode depending on the flags and size of the input array: If #DFT_ROWS is set or the input array has a single row or single column, the function performs a 1D forward or inverse transform of each row of a matrix when #DFT_ROWS is set. Otherwise, it performs a 2D transform. If the input array is real and #DFT_INVERSE is not set, the function performs a forward 1D or 2D transform: When #DFT_COMPLEX_OUTPUT is set, the output is a complex matrix of the same size as input. When #DFT_COMPLEX_OUTPUT is not set, the output is a real matrix of the same size as input. In case of 2D transform, it uses the packed format as shown above. In case of a single 1D transform, it looks like the first row of the matrix above. In case of multiple 1D transforms (when using the #DFT_ROWS flag), each row of the output matrix looks like the first row of the matrix above. If the input array is complex and either #DFT_INVERSE or #DFT_REAL_OUTPUT are not set, the output is a complex array of the same size as input. The function performs a forward or inverse 1D or 2D transform of the whole input array or each row of the input array independently, depending on the flags DFT_INVERSE and DFT_ROWS. When #DFT_INVERSE is set and the input array is real, or it is complex but #DFT_REAL_OUTPUT is set, the output is a real array of the same size as input. The function performs a 1D or 2D inverse transformation of the whole input array or each individual row, depending on the flags #DFT_INVERSE and #DFT_ROWS. If #DFT_SCALE is set, the scaling is done after the transformation. Unlike dct , the function supports arrays of arbitrary size. But only those arrays are processed efficiently, whose sizes can be factorized in a product of small prime numbers (2, 3, and 5 in the current implementation). Such an efficient DFT size can be calculated using the getOptimalDFTSize method. The sample below illustrates how to calculate a DFT-based convolution of two 2D real arrays: void convolveDFT ( InputArray A , InputArray B , OutputArray C ) { // reallocate the output array if needed C . create ( abs ( A . rows - B . rows ) + 1 , abs ( A . cols - B . cols ) + 1 , A . type ( ) ) ; Size dftSize ; // calculate the size of DFT transform dftSize . width = getOptimalDFTSize ( A . cols + B . cols - 1 ) ; dftSize . height = getOptimalDFTSize ( A . rows + B . rows - 1 ) ; // allocate temporary buffers and initialize them with 0 &#39; s Mat tempA ( dftSize , A . type ( ) , Scalar :: all ( 0 ) ) ; Mat tempB ( dftSize , B . type ( ) , Scalar :: all ( 0 ) ) ; // copy A and B to the top - left corners of tempA and tempB , respectively Mat roiA ( tempA , Rect ( 0 , 0 , A . cols , A . rows ) ) ; A . copyTo ( roiA ) ; Mat roiB ( tempB , Rect ( 0 , 0 , B . cols , B . rows ) ) ; B . copyTo ( roiB ) ; // now transform the padded A &amp; B in - place ; // use &quot;nonzeroRows&quot; hint for faster processing dft ( tempA , tempA , 0 , A . rows ) ; dft ( tempB , tempB , 0 , B . rows ) ; // multiply the spectrums ; // the function handles packed spectrum representations well mulSpectrums ( tempA , tempB , tempA ) ; // transform the product back from the frequency domain . // Even though all the result rows will be non - zero , // you need only the first C . rows of them , and thus you // pass nonzeroRows == C . rows dft ( tempA , tempA , DFT_INVERSE + DFT_SCALE , C . rows ) ; // now copy the result back to C . tempA ( Rect ( 0 , 0 , C . cols , C . rows ) ) . copyTo ( C ) ; // all the temporary buffers will be deallocated automatically } To optimize this sample, consider the following approaches: Since nonzeroRows != 0 is passed to the forward transform calls and since A and B are copied to the top-left corners of tempA and tempB, respectively, it is not necessary to clear the whole tempA and tempB. It is only necessary to clear the tempA.cols - A.cols ( tempB.cols - B.cols) rightmost columns of the matrices. This DFT-based convolution does not have to be applied to the whole big arrays, especially if B is significantly smaller than A or vice versa. Instead, you can calculate convolution by parts. To do this, you need to split the output array C into multiple tiles. For each tile, estimate which parts of A and B are required to calculate convolution in this tile. If the tiles in C are too small, the speed will decrease a lot because of repeated work. In the ultimate case, when each tile in C is a single pixel, the algorithm becomes equivalent to the naive convolution algorithm. If the tiles are too big, the temporary arrays tempA and tempB become too big and there is also a slowdown because of bad cache locality. So, there is an optimal tile size somewhere in the middle. If different tiles in C can be calculated in parallel and, thus, the convolution is done by parts, the loop can be threaded. All of the above improvements have been implemented in #matchTemplate and #filter2D . Therefore, by using them, you can get the performance even better than with the above theoretically optimal implementation. Though, those two functions actually calculate cross-correlation, not convolution, so you need to &quot;flip&quot; the second convolution operand B vertically and horizontally using flip . Note : An example using the discrete fourier transform can be found at opencv_source_code/samples/cpp/dft.cpp (Python) An example using the dft functionality to perform Wiener deconvolution can be found at opencv_source/samples/python/deconvolution.py (Python) An example rearranging the quadrants of a Fourier image can be found at opencv_source/samples/python/dft.py src . dst . flags . nonzeroRows . nonzeroRows rows of the input array (#DFT_INVERSE is not set) or only the first nonzeroRows of the output array (#DFT_INVERSE is set) contain non-zeros, thus, the function can handle the rest of the rows more efficiently and save some time; this technique is very useful for calculating array cross-correlation or convolution using DFT. @sa dct , getOptimalDFTSize , mulSpectrums, filter2D , matchTemplate , flip , cartToPolar , magnitude , phase dst : UMat flags : int nonzeroRows : int Python prototype (for reference): dft ( src [ , dst [ , flags [ , nonzeroRows ] ] ] ) -&gt; dst","ref":"OpenCV.html#dft/2","title":"OpenCV.dft/2","type":"function"},{"doc":"","ref":"OpenCV.html#dilate/2","title":"OpenCV.dilate/2","type":"function"},{"doc":"Dilates an image by using a specific structuring element.

The function cv::distanceTransform calculates the approximate or precise distance from every binary image pixel to the nearest zero pixel. For zero image pixels, the distance will obviously be zero. When maskSize == #DIST_MASK_PRECISE and distanceType == #DIST_L2 , the function runs the algorithm described in @cite Felzenszwalb04 . This algorithm is parallelized with the TBB library. In other cases, the algorithm @cite Borgefors86 is used. This means that for a pixel the function finds the shortest path to the nearest zero pixel consisting of basic shifts: horizontal, vertical, diagonal, or knight's move (the latest is available for a \\f$5\\times 5\\f$ mask). The overall distance is calculated as a sum of these basic distances. Since the distance function should be symmetric, all of the horizontal and vertical shifts must have the same cost (denoted as a ), all the diagonal shifts must have the same cost (denoted as b ), and all knight's moves must have the same cost (denoted as c ). For the #DIST_C and #DIST_L1 types, the distance is calculated precisely, whereas for #DIST_L2 (Euclidean distance) the distance can be calculated only with a relative error (a \\f$5\\times 5\\f$ mask gives more accurate results). For a , b , and c , OpenCV uses the values suggested in the original paper: DIST_L1: a = 1, b = 2 DIST_L2: 3 x 3 : a=0.955, b=1.3693 5 x 5 : a=1, b=1.4, c=2.1969 DIST_C: a = 1, b = 1 Typically, for a fast, coarse distance estimation #DIST_L2, a \\f$3\\times 3\\f$ mask is used. For a more accurate distance estimation #DIST_L2, a \\f$5\\times 5\\f$ mask or the precise algorithm is used. Note that both the precise and the approximate algorithms are linear on the number of pixels. This variant of the function does not only compute the minimum distance for each pixel \\f$(x, y)\\f$ but also identifies the nearest connected component consisting of zero pixels (labelType==#DIST_LABEL_CCOMP) or the nearest zero pixel (labelType==#DIST_LABEL_PIXEL). Index of the component/pixel is stored in labels(x, y) . When labelType==#DIST_LABEL_CCOMP, the function automatically finds connected components of zero pixels in the input image and marks them with distinct labels. When labelType==#DIST_LABEL_PIXEL, the function scans through the input image and marks all the zero pixels with distinct labels. In this mode, the complexity is still linear. That is, the function provides a very fast way to compute the Voronoi diagram for a binary image.

The weights must be non-negative and have at least one non-zero value. signature2 . may be different. The total weights may be different. In this case an extra &quot;dummy&quot; point is added to either signature1 or signature2. The weights must be non-negative and have at least one non-zero value. distType . cost . is used, lower boundary lowerBound cannot be calculated because it needs a metric function. lowerBound . signatures that is a distance between mass centers. The lower boundary may not be calculated if the user-defined cost matrix is used, the total weights of point configurations are not equal, or if the signatures consist of weights only (the signature matrices have a single column). You must** initialize \\ lowerBound . If the calculated distance between mass centers is greater or equal to *lowerBound (it means that the signatures are far enough), the function does not calculate EMD. In any case *lowerBound is set to the calculated distance between mass centers on return.

For example, a regular chessboard has 8 x 8 squares and 7 x 7 internal corners, that is, points where the black squares touch each other.

The Method is based on the paper @cite duda2018 &quot;Accurate Detection and Localization of Checkerboard Corners for Calibration&quot; demonstrating that the returned sub-pixel positions are more accurate than the one returned by cornerSubPix allowing a precise camera calibration for demanding applications. In the case, the flags @ref CALIB_CB_LARGER or @ref CALIB_CB_MARKER are given, the result can be recovered from the optional meta array. Both flags are helpful to use calibration patterns exceeding the field of view of the camera. These oversized patterns allow more accurate calibrations as corners can be utilized, which are as close as possible to the image borders. For a consistent coordinate system across all images, the optional marker (see image below) can be used to move the origin of the board to the location where the black circle is located. Note : The function requires a white boarder with roughly the same width as one of the checkerboard fields around the whole board to improve the detection in various environments.

That is, for each pixel \\f$(u, v)\\f$ in the destination (corrected and rectified) image, the function computes the corresponding coordinates in the source image (that is, in the original image from camera). The following process is applied: \\f[ \\begin{array}{l} x \\leftarrow (u - {c'}_x)/{f'}_x \\\\ y \\leftarrow (v - {c'}_y)/{f'}_y \\\\ {[X\\,Y\\,W]} ^T \\leftarrow R^{-1}*[x \\, y \\, 1]^T \\\\ x' \\leftarrow X/W \\\\ y' \\leftarrow Y/W \\\\ r^2 \\leftarrow x'^2 + y'^2 \\\\ x'' \\leftarrow x' \\frac{1 + k_1 r^2 + k_2 r^4 + k_3 r^6}{1 + k_4 r^2 + k_5 r^4 + k_6 r^6} + 2p_1 x' y' + p_2(r^2 + 2 x'^2) + s_1 r^2 + s_2 r^4\\\\ y'' \\leftarrow y' \\frac{1 + k_1 r^2 + k_2 r^4 + k_3 r^6}{1 + k_4 r^2 + k_5 r^4 + k_6 r^6} + p_1 (r^2 + 2 y'^2) + 2 p_2 x' y' + s_3 r^2 + s_4 r^4 \\\\ s\\vecthree{x'''}{y'''}{1} = \\vecthreethree{R_{33}(\\tau_x, \\tau_y)}{0}{-R_{13}((\\tau_x, \\tau_y)} {0}{R_{33}(\\tau_x, \\tau_y)}{-R_{23}(\\tau_x, \\tau_y)} {0}{0}{1} R(\\tau_x, \\tau_y) \\vecthree{x''}{y''}{1}\\\\ map_x(u,v) \\leftarrow x''' f_x + c_x \\\\ map_y(u,v) \\leftarrow y''' f_y + c_y \\end{array} \\f] where \\f$(k_1, k_2, p_1, p_2[, k_3[, k_4, k_5, k_6[, s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4[, \\tau_x, \\tau_y]]]])\\f$ are the distortion coefficients. In case of a stereo camera, this function is called twice: once for each camera head, after #stereoRectify, which in its turn is called after #stereoCalibrate. But if the stereo camera was not calibrated, it is still possible to compute the rectification transformations directly from the fundamental matrix using #stereoRectifyUncalibrated. For each camera, the function computes homography H as the rectification transformation in a pixel domain, not a rotation matrix R in 3D space. R can be computed from H as \\f[\\texttt{R} = \\texttt{cameraMatrix} ^{-1} \\cdot \\texttt{H} \\cdot \\texttt{cameraMatrix}\\f] where cameraMatrix can be chosen arbitrarily. cameraMatrix . distCoeffs . \\f$(k_1, k_2, p_1, p_2[, k_3[, k_4, k_5, k_6[, s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4[, \\tau_x, \\tau_y]]]])\\f$ of 4, 5, 8, 12 or 14 elements.

Therefore, objectPoints.size(), imagePoints1.size(), and imagePoints2.size() need to be equal as well as objectPoints[i].size(), imagePoints1[i].size(), and imagePoints2[i].size() need to be equal for each i. imagePoints1 . observed by the first camera.

To provide the backward compatibility, this extra flag should be explicitly specified to make the calibration function use the rational model and return 8 coefficients. If the flag is not set, the function computes and returns only 5 distortion coefficients. @ref CALIB_THIN_PRISM_MODEL Coefficients s1, s2, s3 and s4 are enabled. To provide the backward compatibility, this extra flag should be explicitly specified to make the calibration function use the thin prism model and return 12 coefficients.

If @ref CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is set, the coefficient from the supplied distCoeffs matrix is used. Otherwise, it is set to 0. criteria . The function estimates the transformation between two cameras making a stereo pair. If one computes the poses of an object relative to the first camera and to the second camera, ( \\f$R_1\\f$,\\f$T_1\\f$ ) and (\\f$R_2\\f$,\\f$T_2\\f$), respectively, for a stereo camera where the relative position and orientation between the two cameras are fixed, then those poses definitely relate to each other. This means, if the relative position and orientation (\\f$R\\f$,\\f$T\\f$) of the two cameras is known, it is possible to compute (\\f$R_2\\f$,\\f$T_2\\f$) when (\\f$R_1\\f$,\\f$T_1\\f$) is given. This is what the described function does. It computes (\\f$R\\f$,\\f$T\\f$) such that: \\f[R_2=R R_1\\f] \\f[T_2=R T_1 + T.\\f] Therefore, one can compute the coordinate representation of a 3D point for the second camera's coordinate system when given the point's coordinate representation in the first camera's coordinate system: \\f[\\begin{bmatrix} X_2 \\\\ Y_2 \\\\ Z_2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} R &amp; T \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} X_1 \\\\ Y_1 \\\\ Z_1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}.\\f] Optionally, it computes the essential matrix E: \\f[E= \\vecthreethree{0}{-T_2}{T_1}{T_2}{0}{-T_0}{-T_1}{T_0}{0} R\\f] where \\f$T_i\\f$ are components of the translation vector \\f$T\\f$ : \\f$T=[T_0, T_1, T_2]^T\\f$ . And the function can also compute the fundamental matrix F: \\f[F = cameraMatrix2^{-T}\\cdot E \\cdot cameraMatrix1^{-1}\\f] Besides the stereo-related information, the function can also perform a full calibration of each of the two cameras. However, due to the high dimensionality of the parameter space and noise in the input data, the function can diverge from the correct solution. If the intrinsic parameters can be estimated with high accuracy for each of the cameras individually (for example, using #calibrateCamera ), you are recommended to do so and then pass @ref CALIB_FIX_INTRINSIC flag to the function along with the computed intrinsic parameters. Otherwise, if all the parameters are estimated at once, it makes sense to restrict some parameters, for example, pass @ref CALIB_SAME_FOCAL_LENGTH and @ref CALIB_ZERO_TANGENT_DIST flags, which is usually a reasonable assumption. Similarly to #calibrateCamera, the function minimizes the total re-projection error for all the points in all the available views from both cameras. The function returns the final value of the re-projection error. e : UMat f : UMat perViewErrors : UMat flags : int criteria : TermCriteria Python prototype (for reference): stereoCalibrateExtended ( objectPoints , imagePoints1 , imagePoints2 , cameraMatrix1 , distCoeffs1 , cameraMatrix2 , distCoeffs2 , imageSize , R , T [ , E [ , F [ , perViewErrors [ , flags [ , criteria ] ] ] ] ] ) -&gt; retval , cameraMatrix1 , distCoeffs1 , cameraMatrix2 , distCoeffs2 , R , T , E , F , perViewErrors","ref":"OpenCV.html#stereoCalibrateExtended/11","title":"OpenCV.stereoCalibrateExtended/11","type":"function"},{"doc":"","ref":"OpenCV.html#stereoRectify/7","title":"OpenCV.stereoRectify/7","type":"function"},{"doc":"Computes rectification transforms for each head of a calibrated stereo camera. cameraMatrix1 . distCoeffs1 . cameraMatrix2 . distCoeffs2 . imageSize . r . see @ref stereoCalibrate. t . see @ref stereoCalibrate. r1 . brings points given in the unrectified first camera's coordinate system to points in the rectified first camera's coordinate system.

Otherwise, the parameter should be between 0 and 1. alpha=0 means that the rectified images are zoomed and shifted so that only valid pixels are visible (no black areas after rectification). alpha=1 means that the rectified image is decimated and shifted so that all the pixels from the original images from the cameras are retained in the rectified images (no source image pixels are lost). Any intermediate value yields an intermediate result between those two extreme cases. newImageSize . #initUndistortRectifyMap (see the stereo_calib.cpp sample in OpenCV samples directory).

If alpha=0 , the ROIs cover the whole images. Otherwise, they are likely to be smaller (see the picture below). validPixROI2 . are valid. If alpha=0 , the ROIs cover the whole images. Otherwise, they are likely to be smaller (see the picture below). The function computes the rotation matrices for each camera that (virtually) make both camera image planes the same plane. Consequently, this makes all the epipolar lines parallel and thus simplifies the dense stereo correspondence problem. The function takes the matrices computed by #stereoCalibrate as input. As output, it provides two rotation matrices and also two projection matrices in the new coordinates. The function distinguishes the following two cases: Horizontal stereo : the first and the second camera views are shifted relative to each other mainly along the x-axis (with possible small vertical shift). In the rectified images, the corresponding epipolar lines in the left and right cameras are horizontal and have the same y-coordinate. P1 and P2 look like: \\f[\\texttt{P1} = \\begin{bmatrix} f &amp; 0 &amp; cx_1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; f &amp; cy &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\f] \\f[\\texttt{P2} = \\begin{bmatrix} f &amp; 0 &amp; cx_2 &amp; T_x*f \\\\ 0 &amp; f &amp; cy &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix} ,\\f] where \\f$T_x\\f$ is a horizontal shift between the cameras and \\f$cx_1=cx_2\\f$ if @ref CALIB_ZERO_DISPARITY is set. Vertical stereo : the first and the second camera views are shifted relative to each other mainly in the vertical direction (and probably a bit in the horizontal direction too). The epipolar lines in the rectified images are vertical and have the same x-coordinate. P1 and P2 look like: \\f[\\texttt{P1} = \\begin{bmatrix} f &amp; 0 &amp; cx &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; f &amp; cy_1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\f] \\f[\\texttt{P2} = \\begin{bmatrix} f &amp; 0 &amp; cx &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; f &amp; cy_2 &amp; T_y*f \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix},\\f] where \\f$T_y\\f$ is a vertical shift between the cameras and \\f$cy_1=cy_2\\f$ if @ref CALIB_ZERO_DISPARITY is set. As you can see, the first three columns of P1 and P2 will effectively be the new &quot;rectified&quot; camera matrices. The matrices, together with R1 and R2 , can then be passed to #initUndistortRectifyMap to initialize the rectification map for each camera. See below the screenshot from the stereo_calib.cpp sample. Some red horizontal lines pass through the corresponding image regions. This means that the images are well rectified, which is what most stereo correspondence algorithms rely on.
